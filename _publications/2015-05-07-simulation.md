title: "Simulation of aluminum alloy flowing in friction stir welding with a multiphysics field model"
collection: publications
permalink: /publication/2015-05-07-simulation
excerpt: 'The three-dimensional model for friction stir welding was established by coupling thermal, force, and flowing fields. The weld shape, surface stripes, weld defect, temperature field, and material flow behavior were predicted. The transient heat transfer phenomenon and material mixing pattern at the stir zone was primarily studied. The material flow mechanism was investigated. The experimental results strongly supported the reliability and accuracy of the model and simulation. The rotational speed to welding speed ratio Rω/Uw plays an important role in transient heat transfer, temperature field, velocity field, material mixing pattern, and weld defect appearance.'
