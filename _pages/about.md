I am a Postdoctoral Scholar at Northwestern University. I earned
my Ph.D in Mechanical Engineering from the University of Maryland, College Park, 
after which I worked as a Research Scientist in Siemens Techonolgy for one and a half years.

My [research](research) explores how machine learning and artificial intellegence can 
assist human in solving engineering design problems. Particularly, I'm interested in
developing tools using deep learning, reinforcement learning, active learning, statistical modeling,
and engineering optimization to improve design synthesis and design space exploration.
